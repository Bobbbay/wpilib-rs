<p align="center"> A memory-safe, modular, expressive alternative to programming FRC robots </p>

`WPIlib-rs` is a memory-safe, modular, and expressive strongly-typed low-level alternative to programming FRC robots. This suite of libraries binds and builds upon [WPILib](https://wpilib.org/), enabling [First Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) teams to *safely*, *efficiently*, and *legally* program their robots, with Rust.

## Features

 * **Idiomatic abstractions** (on top of WPILib's internal library)
 * A **low-level interface** (interact directly with the HAL, if needed)
 * **Directly bound to WPILib** (no fluff in between)

## Getting started

To get started with `wpilib-rs`, simply depend on `wpilib`, and read through our documentation.
